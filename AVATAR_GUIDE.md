# How to Get a Realistic Indian Female Avatar (VRM)

To replace the anime avatar with a realistic one, you need a **.vrm** file.

## Option 1: Ready Player Me (Recommended for Realism)
1.  Go to [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/).
2.  Create your avatar (choose "Female" and customize to look Indian).
3.  **Important:** You need to download it as a **.vrm** file, not .glb.
    *   If the standard download is .glb, you can use a converter or look for the "Download as VRM" option if available in your specific app integration.
    *   **Alternative:** Use [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/en/) and search for "Realistic".

## Option 2: Use a Pre-made Model
If you have a `.vrm` file:
1.  Rename it to `avatar.vrm`.
2.  Place it in the folder: `d:\Jarvis-main\web\public\models\`
    *   (Create the `models` folder if it doesn't exist inside `public`).
3.  The app will automatically load `avatar.vrm`.

## What I have done for you:
I have updated the code to:
1.  **Animate the body**: She will now breathe, sway, and gesture while talking.
2.  **Look for `avatar.vrm`**: Just drop your file in `web/public/models/`.
