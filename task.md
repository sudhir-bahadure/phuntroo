- [x] Implement lip-sync animation
- [x] Implement body gesture animations
- [x] Create chat interface UI
- [x] Add voice input/output controls
- [x] Implement real-time avatar synchronization

## Phase 4: Avatar & Animation
- [x] Generate/configure realistic Indian female 3D model
- [x] Map uploaded face image to 3D model
- [x] Create idle animations
