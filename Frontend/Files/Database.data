Sudhir : Give lyrics of hanuman chalisa
Jarvis : Here are the lyrics to the Hanuman Chalisa:
Jai Hanuman gyan gun sagar
Jai Kapis tihun lok ujagar
Ram doot atulit bal dhama
Anjaani-putra Pavan sut nama
Mahavir Vikram Bajrangi
Kumati nivar sumati Ke sangi
Kanchan varan viraj subesa
Kanan kundal kunchit kesa
Hath vajra ao dhwaja birajai
Sankar sukhwana kahu mori pai
Tihu lok sankar siyave
Kaju nisichar nayi ur laye
Asur nikandan Ram dulare
Ramashray sarva ke sukhi sare
Ayodhya vihar agaman nirmana
Ram milayi rajpad deenha
Lakshman prachod dashrath kaje
Sita man bhaya ikichaaje
Sita Ram charit suhaaye
Sukh kari kahu mori pai
Ashta sidhi nav nidhi ke
Data ram das rakhwale
Sankat mochan nau avtara
Sri Ram jee ke sara
Sri Ram jee ke sara
Sri Ram jee ke sara
Sri Ram jee ke sara
Tihu lok hanumat jalaya
Sri Ram jee ke sara
Jai jai jai hanuman gosai
Kripa karahu gurudev ki nayi
Jo sat bar path kare koi
Chute bandi maha sukha hoi
Jo yah par hai hanuman chalisa
Hoye siddhi sakhi gaureesa
Tihu lok hanumat yasha
Sri Ram jee ke sara
Sri Ram jee ke sara
Sri Ram jee ke sara
Sri Ram jee ke sara
